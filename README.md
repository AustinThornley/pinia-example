# pinia

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

OR,

### *** If you wish to create an app from scratch, create a folder for your project, and run this command.

```sh
npm init vue@latest
```

(This will ask you to install it if is not installed)

After it is installed, it will ask for a project name, and various other configuartions for a Vue app. For this, I simply chose Pinia and nothing else.

*** I use this because it has more options to add on other various Vue tools than this command: 
```sh
npm create vite@latest
```
